# french-conjugator

A Python3 program to conjugate common French verbs in different tenses.

I've taken a couple of French courses at the
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and this program is designed to
conjugate common verbs in the tenses that I have learned so far, including:

* Passé composé
* Imparfait
* Présent
* Futur proche
* Futur simple

I may add more tenses as I learn them.

You can run the program by executing `src/main.py`.

If you have any pointers you'd like to share about my code, or find any verbs
that aren't conjugated correctly by the program, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jdw1996/french-conjugator/issues/new) or
email me at [jdwinters96@gmail.com](mailto:jdwinters96@gmail.com).
